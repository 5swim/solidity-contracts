# Endorsable contract

Endorsable is a simple contract that facillitates post commit endorsement of a contract.

This can be used for _non-essential_ recognition, acknowledgement or endorsement of a contract by a third-party.

By request of contract owner, endorsements can be added to an endorsable contract at any stage.
The endorsments can also be removed (by the owner) or revoked (by the endorser).

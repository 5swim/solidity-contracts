# Endorsable contract

Endorsable is a simple contract that facillitates post mining endorsement of a contract.

This can be used for _non-essential_ recognition, acknowledgement or endorsement of a contract by a third-party.

By request of contract owner, endorsements can be added to an endorsable contract at any stage after contract has been mined.
The endorsments can also be removed (by the owner) or revoked (by the endorser).
